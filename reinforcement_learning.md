### Dueling Network Architectures for Deep Reinforcement Learning [[ICML 2016]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06581.pdf)
  - Ziyu Wang, Tom Schaul, Matteo Hessel, Hado van Hasselt, Marc Lanctot, Nando de Freitas
  - Two-stream DQN, each representing V(value function) and A(advantage function)
  - Elinimates the instability of adding two numbers of different scale(V is usually much larger than A)
  - Updates actions more frequently than a single-stream DQN, where only a single Q value is updated for each observation
  - Implicitly splits the credit assignment problem into a recursive binary problem of "now or later"
  - Arguably the first major breakthrough in network architectures specifically for deep RL
  - Only works for finite action spaces

  - David Pfau, Oriol Vinyals
  - Constructs an Actor-Critic architecture that is equivalent to GAN: state is randomly chosen between a real image and an image generated by the actor, action is setting every pixel in an image, reward if 1 if real image and 0 if synthetic image
  - Cross-examines the approaches used to stabilize GANs and AC architectures

  - Uses a 'sum-tree' data structure to perform this quickly, where the value of a parent node is the sum of its children
  - Uses importance sampling weights to counteract the change in state distribution
  - Inspired by prioritized sweeping
  
### Deep Reinforcement Learning with Double Q-Learning [[AAAI 2016]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.06461.pdf)

  - Uses different Q networks for action selection and evaluation
  - Empirically shows that Double DQN outperforms DQN

Fidjeland, Georg Ostrovski, Stig Petersen, Charles Beattie, Amir Sadik, Ioannis Antonoglou, Helen King, Dharshan Kumaran, Daan Wierstra, Shane Legg & Demis Hassabis
  - Appeared earlier in [NIPS 2013 Deep Learning Workshop](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.5602.pdf)
  - Proposes using a deep convolutional network for Q-learning
  - Uses experience replay(similar to  [Neural Fitted Q Iteration](https://github.com/yoonholee/Reinforcement-Learning-Survey/blob/master/q_learning.md#neural-fitted-q-iteration---first-experiences-with-a-data-efficient-neural-reinforcement-learning-method-ecml-2005)), storing only the last N experience tuples while using an epsilon greedy policy
  - Points out that a scheme similar to experience replay happens in the hippocampus of the mammalian brain
  - Difference with [Neural Fitted Q Iteration](https://github.com/yoonholee/Reinforcement-Learning-Survey/blob/master/q_learning.md#neural-fitted-q-iteration---first-experiences-with-a-data-efficient-neural-reinforcement-learning-method-ecml-2005)) is that this is an off-policy learning algorithm where the network determines the policy
  - Periodically fixes network parameters for stability
  - Mentions multiple times that a scheme similar to prioritized sweeping would speed up convergence, which is exactly [Prioritized Experience Replay](https://github.com/yoonholee/Reinforcement-Learning-Survey/blob/master/q_learning.md#prioritized-experience-replay-iclr-2016)
  
### Trust Region Policy Optimization [[ICML 2015]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.05477)
  - John Schulman, Sergey Levine, Philipp Moritz, Michael Jordan, Pieter Abbeel
  - Builds on [Approximately Optimal Approximate Reinforcement Learning](https://github.com/yoonholee/Reinforcement-Learning-Survey/blob/master/policy_gradient.md#approximately-optimal-approximate-reinforcement-learning-icml-2002)
  - Instead of using a linear mixture, TRPO uses average KL divergence to ensure that the next policy is sufficiently close to current policy(in practice, approximate L linearly and KL divergence quadratically)
  - The natural policy gradient has the same direction as TRPO; the difference is that TRPO chooses a step size based on the trust region defined by KL divergence
  - Empirical performance is comparable to state of the art in both robotic locomotion and atari games
  
### Deep Recurrent Q-Learning for Partially Observable MDPs [[arxiv 2015]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.06527v3.pdf)
  - Matthew Hausknecht, Peter Stone
  - Attaches an LSTM to a standard DQN, so that it can learn even with only timestep as input
  - Experiments show that this is superior to DQN in an env where at each timestep, the state is obscured with probability 1/2

  - Jan Peters, Stefan Schaal
  - Proves that the weight vector discussed in [A Natural Policy Gradient](https://github.com/yoonholee/Reinforcement-Learning-Survey/blob/master/policy_gradient.md#a-natural-policy-gradient-nips-2002) is in fact the natural gradient, rather than just a gradient defined by an average of point fisher information matrices

  - Suggests a REINFORCE-style algorithm using the natural gradient
  
### Neural Fitted Q Iteration - First Experiences with a Data Efficient Neural Reinforcement Learning Method [[ECML 2005]](http://ml.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/_media/publications/rieecml05.pdf)
  - Martin Riedmiller
  - Proposes using a neural network for Q-learning
  - Input is a set of (s,a,s') and the neural network does RProp until convergence
  - Closer to supervised learning than reinforcement learning, since the algorithm never acts
 
### Approximately Optimal Approximate Reinforcement Learning [[ICML 2002]](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./jcl/papers/aoarl/Final.pdf)

  - Points out the inefficiency of policy gradients using two example MDPs(section 3.2)
  - Derives a conservative policy iteration scheme that finds a policy that is almost optimal(within epsilon) in polynomial(w.r.t. epsilon) time
  - The key idea is that we can get a provably improved policy by using a linear mixture between the current policy and the greedily improved policy
