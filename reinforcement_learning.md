  - Builds on [Approximately Optimal Approximate Reinforcement Learning](https://github.com/yoonholee/Reinforcement-Learning-Survey/blob/master/policy_gradient.md#approximately-optimal-approximate-reinforcement-learning-icml-2002)
  - Instead of using a linear mixture, TRPO uses average KL divergence to ensure that the next policy is sufficiently close to current policy(in practice, approximate L linearly and KL divergence quadratically)
  - The natural policy gradient has the same direction as TRPO; the difference is that TRPO chooses a step size based on the trust region defined by KL divergence

  - Proves(under mild regularity conditions) that all previously developed machinery for stochastic policy gradients(i.e. compatible function approximation, actor-critic, natural gradients, and episodic/batch methods) apply to deterministic policy gradients.

  - Proves that the weight vector discussed in [A Natural Policy Gradient](https://github.com/yoonholee/Reinforcement-Learning-Survey/blob/master/policy_gradient.md#a-natural-policy-gradient-nips-2002) is actually the natural gradient, rather than just a gradient defined by an average of point Fisher information matrices
  - Suggests an Actor-Critic style algorithm using the natural gradient
